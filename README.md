# SMZg
code for SM Zg analysis
1. main: to create minitree for further analysis
2. unfolding: to get information at particle level for phton pt, Mllg, number of jet
3. Other background from ttbar, diboson estimated from MC.
4. templateFit: get signal and main background from DYJet by fitting photon MVA
5. NPcor: non-perturbative correction for parton showering to get back parton level
6. sscor: bias correction for sideband selection
5. sbsel: sideband scan to choose best region
